                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a final-year PhD student (Environmental Science) at the National University of Ireland Galway. I’m scheduled to viva this summer and am currently seeking
                    new and exciting career opportunities as a lecturer or postdoc!</p>
                <p>Born and raised in southern California, I completed both my BSc (Biology) and MSc (Entomology) at the University of California Riverside (UCR). As an undergrad,
                    my studies focused on animal evolution and ecology, and in my third and fourth years I worked with Drs Paul and Irma de Ley on freshwater nematode ecology.
                    After receiving my BSc in 2008, I worked as a research technician with Drs Mark Hoddle and Nicola Irvin for five years on various invasive species, biological
                    control, and insect ecology projects. I completed my MSc with Dr Hoddle on the parasitoids and hyperparasitoids within the Asian citrus psyllid (<em>Diaphorina
                        citri</em>) classical biological control complex, funded by grants from the US Department of Agriculture and the California Department of Food and
                    Agriculture.</p>
                <p>In 2015, I moved to Galway, Ireland to pursue a PhD at the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) with Professor Michael Gormally. My current research has
                    focused on developing a conservation biological control programme for agricultural pest slugs in Ireland using a native Irish parasitoid fly, <em>Tetanocera
                        elata</em>. This project has been funded by the Government of Ireland Postgraduate Research Fellowship (Irish Research Council), Hardiman Research
                    Scholarship (NUIG), and the Thomas Crawford Hayes Research Fund (NUIG). Throughout my research career, I have worked on numerous insect and crop systems, as
                    well has partaking in research collaborations with a range of stakeholders (state and local agencies, growers, homeowners, and researchers from other
                    universities).</p>
                <p>More about my previous and ongoing research can be found on my <a href="research.html">research page</a>. I am also passionate about science communication and am
                    active in public outreach. Check out the <a href="outreach.html">Outreach section</a> for an overview of my outreach involvement, or follow me on <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/ABEentomology">Twitter</a> for event updates!</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I love being outside and going on excursions with my doggo Kaylee [link pic]. I am an avid baker [link pic] and love developing new recipes
                    [link pic]; I’ve also been known to give colourful commentary while watching the Great British Bake Off. I’m a huge fantasy/sci-fi nerd and gaming enthusiast,
                    and can throw dice with the best of them.</p>
